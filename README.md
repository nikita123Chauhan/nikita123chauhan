## 🚀 About Me:
I'm a dedicated and self-motivated final-year B.Tech student specializing in full stack development. My primary interest is in creating practical, real-world solutions through technology. Over the past few years, I have worked on diverse projects ranging from a **Student ERP Dashboard** and an **Expense Tracker** to a **Sudoku Game** using JavaFX and algorithms. I enjoy exploring both frontend and backend technologies, and I have also ventured into machine learning through projects like **WhatsApp Sentiment Analysis** and **Food Recognition** during internships.

I am currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills in software development while continuing to grow professionally. In addition to coding, I have a deep passion for teaching, having provided home tuition to students, and I am actively involved in volunteering through various charitable initiatives.
